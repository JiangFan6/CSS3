VERSION 2.1.1 CHANGES

To remove some noise from the tab completions menu, I've removed all completions
with vendor prefixes. You won't see properties like these in the completions
menu anymore.

    -ms-user-select
    -moz-appearance
    -webkit-appearance

The syntax highlighter will still highlight them just fine, however.

In a modern workflow, you shouldn't have to bother with writing vendor-prefixed
properties by hand. You should let Autoprefixer do that for you. You are
encouraged to use Autoprefixer to automatically fill in vendor-prefixed
properties, selectors, etc.

Here's how to install it:

Linux / Windows
ctrl+shift+p > Package Control: Install Package > Autoprefixer

Mac
cmd+shift+p  > Package Control: Install Package > Autoprefixer
